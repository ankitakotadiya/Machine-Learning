# Crop Disease Detection
Crop disease detection plays a crucial role in agriculture management as it enables timely and accurate identification of disease, leading to effective treatment and prevention strategies. 

In the recent years, various machine learning algorithms have been applied to automate the process of disease detection. This project focuses on comparing the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Na√Øve Bayes, Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Transfer Learning, and Vision Transformer models and suggest best model for crop disease detection.

To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, extensive experiments are performed using crop disease datasets. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Adam loss function are employed as evaluation metrics. 

Experiment results revel the strength and weakness of each approach, and the proposed model can aid researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate algorithms and technique for building accurate and reliable disease detection system in agriculture, thereby contributing to improve crop health and yield.
